PLANX COMMON REPOSITORY LOCK (v4.0)

# IMPORT POLICY:
- Allowed importers: planx-engine
- Forbidden importers: planx-sdk-*, planx-plugin-*

# SCOPE:
- Infra utilities only
- No business logic


# The dir metrics:
ALLOWED:
- Prometheus registry
- Engine-level counters
- Process metrics

FORBIDDEN contents:
- Pipeline metrics
- Plugin metrics
- Per-session metrics

Plugin metrics can only be reported through SDK → Engine,
not directly import common.

# The Dir telemetry:
STRICT RULES:
ONLY responsible for:
- tracer / meter provider initialization
- exporter wiring

FORBIDDEN:
- span semantic definition
- pipeline / plugin span naming
- SDK helper

If you find telemetry starts importing SDK / proto in the future,
that's a signal to split it immediately.
